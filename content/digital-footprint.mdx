## Introduction

In today's digital age, where data is considered the new gold, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain one's privacy. The recent rise in social media platforms, coupled with a seemingly endless stream of data breaches and privacy scandals, have made it more important than ever to be vigilant about our online presence. This realization led me on a personal journey to reduce my digital footprint and take control of my online privacy.

## The Dark Side of Social Media

While social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, and YouTube can be great tools for connecting with others and staying informed about current events or industry trends, they come at a high cost – our personal information. These platforms collect vast amounts of data on users for marketing purposes and often share this information with third parties without our knowledge or consent.

I began questioning the value I was getting from these platforms when I noticed people oversharing on LinkedIn. It struck me as odd that we would willingly divulge so much personal information in exchange for networking opportunities or career advancement. This concern was further exacerbated by news reports detailing major data breaches affecting millions of users across various social media sites.

### Some of the most well-known data breaches include:

- Facebook: In 2019, it was revealed that two datasets from Facebook apps had been exposed to the public internet. The information related to more than 533 million Facebook users and included phone numbers, account names, and Facebook IDs. However, two years later (April 2021) the data was posted for free, indicating new and real criminal intent surrounding the data.

- LinkedIn: In 2021, a massive security breach resulted in over 700 million LinkedIn user accounts being compromised. The exposed data included email addresses, passwords, and other sensitive account details – leaving affected users vulnerable to identity theft and phishing attacks.

- Yahoo (now owned by Verizon): One of the largest data breaches in history occurred at Yahoo between 2013-2014 when an estimated 500 million user accounts were affected. The stolen data included personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, hashed passwords, birth dates, and security questions and answers, some of which were unencrypted.

- Twitter: In May of 2018, social media giant Twitter notified users of a glitch that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log, making all user passwords accessible to the internal network. Twitter told its 330 million users to change their passwords, but the company said it fixed the bug and that there was no indication of a breach or misuse, but encouraged the password update as a precaution. Twitter did not disclose how many users were impacted but indicated that the number of users was significant and that they were exposed for several months.

- Instagram: In 2019 it was reported that over 49 million Instagram user records, including celebrities and influencers, were exposed in a database that was left unsecured. The exposed data included users' profile pictures, biographies, follower numbers, and location information.

These high-profile breaches serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with sharing personal information on social media platforms. It's no wonder that many individuals are reconsidering their use of these platforms and seeking alternative ways to maintain an online presence while safeguarding their privacy.

## Taking Control 
### Deleting Social Media Accounts:

After weighing the pros and cons of maintaining accounts on these platforms, I decided that the drawbacks far outweighed any benefits they provided. So I took the plunge and deleted my LinkedIn account along with Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube – all in an effort to regain control over my personal information.

### Creating a Personal Website:

In my last blog post, I shared a technical guide on how to create a personal website. I made this decision because I wanted to maintain control over my online presence and limit third-party access to my information. By using secure hosting services and selectively sharing my work experience and skills, I was able to present an authentic and professional image while safeguarding my privacy.

### Switching to a Secure Email Provider:

Deleting my Gmail account was just the first step in securing my online communications. I researched various secure email providers that prioritize user privacy and ultimately chose one that met my needs. By using an email provider with end-to-end encryption, I can now communicate confidently, knowing that only the intended recipient will be able to read my messages.

### Using a Password Manager:

Another essential aspect of protecting our online presence is ensuring we use strong, unique passwords for each account we create. Remembering multiple complex passwords can be challenging, which is why I opted to use a password manager. This tool not only helps me generate strong passwords but also securely stores them so I don't have to remember each one individually – all while keeping them safe from potential hackers.

### Embracing Two-Factor Authentication with YubiKey:

To further enhance the security of my online accounts, I began using two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever it was available. One of the most effective 2FA methods is using an authentication token like YubiKey – a physical device that acts as an additional layer of security when logging into accounts. By requiring both something you know (your password) and something you have (the YubiKey), unauthorized access becomes much more difficult for potential attackers.

#### While many people opt for 2FA methods that use mobile numbers or email addresses, these methods are not without their drawbacks:

1. Mobile Number Vulnerabilities: Relying on a mobile number for 2FA can expose users to SIM swap attacks, where hackers take control of a user's phone number by convincing the carrier to transfer it to a new SIM card under their control. Once they gain access to the phone number, attackers can intercept authentication codes sent via SMS, potentially granting them access to the user's accounts.

2. Email Security Concerns: Using an email address as a second factor for authentication may seem convenient but also carries risks. If an attacker gains access to your email account through phishing or other means, they could potentially receive any 2FA codes sent via email and bypass this layer of protection.

#### Security tokens like YubiKey offer several advantages over mobile number and email-based 2FA:

1. Physical Security: Since YubiKeys are physical devices that must be present during the login process, it is much more challenging for attackers to gain unauthorized access remotely.

2. No Reliance on Third-Party Services: Unlike SMS or email-based 2FA methods which rely on external services (mobile carriers or email providers), security tokens work independently – eliminating vulnerabilities associated with third-party services being compromised or experiencing downtime.

3. Resilience Against Phishing Attacks: A common tactic used by hackers is to create fake login pages that trick users into providing their credentials and 2FA codes. With a security token like YubiKey, users must physically interact with the device to complete the authentication process – making it more difficult for attackers to deceive users through phishing attempts.

4. Universal Compatibility: Many security tokens, including YubiKey, support multiple authentication standards (such as FIDO U2F, FIDO2, and WebAuthn), making them compatible with a wide range of online services and platforms.

By embracing two-factor authentication with tools like YubiKey, we can add an extra layer of protection to our online accounts – ensuring that even if our passwords are compromised, unauthorized access remains significantly more challenging for potential attackers.
The Main Message: If You're Not Paying for the Product, You Are the Product!

Throughout this journey towards reclaiming my online privacy and reducing my digital footprint, one central theme emerged: if you're not paying for a product or service, then chances are your personal information is being sold or shared in some way. It's crucial to recognize this fact and take steps towards protecting ourselves from becoming mere commodities in today's data-driven world.

## Conclusion

My personal journey has taught me that taking control of our digital lives and prioritizing privacy is not only possible but essential in today's world. By deleting unnecessary social media accounts, creating a personal website, using secure email providers and password managers, and embracing two-factor authentication with tools like YubiKey, we can all take steps towards reducing our digital footprint and protecting our online privacy.

**Remember:** it's up to us to make informed decisions about what we share online and how we choose to navigate the digital landscape. After all, if we don't protect our privacy, who will?
