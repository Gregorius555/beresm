## Introduction

In this blog post, I'll take you through my personal journey of setting up a sleek and modern personal website using the versatile Next.js framework and Lee Robinson's portfolio template. We'll cover various aspects of Next.js, from rendering strategies and routing to testing and deployment.

## Getting Started with Next.js

Before diving into the world of Next.js, I needed to understand the basics of this powerful framework. Next.js is a scalable and high-performance React.js framework for modern web development. It offers a large set of features out of the box, including hybrid rendering, route prefetching, automatic image optimization, and internationalization. These features make Next.js the perfect choice for creating a blog, an e-commerce website, or a simple website.

### Rendering Strategies and Routing

As I began exploring Next.js, I quickly realized that it's incredibly versatile and well-suited for building real-world applications. I learned how to create scalable Next.js architectures and choose between different rendering strategies, such as client-side rendering (CSR), static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and incremental static regeneration (ISR). Each of these strategies has its own set of advantages, and Next.js enables developers to easily switch between them.

In my quest to create the perfect website, I had to determine the most suitable rendering strategy. I decided to use a combination of SSG and ISR for my website, as it would provide both speed and flexibility. This way, I could generate static HTML at build time and regenerate the pages as needed, ensuring optimal performance.

Next, I delved into the powerful routing system and built-in components that Next.js offers. By leveraging the built-in Link component, I could easily create dynamic and performant navigation within my website. Next.js's automatic route prefetching also allowed my website to load pages faster, offering an improved user experience.

### Testing and Integration

As I continued building my website, I knew that it was essential to ensure its stability and reliability. Next.js made it simple to write unit tests and integration tests for my application. By using popular testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library, I could verify that my website's components and features functioned as intended.

## Designing and Building Modern Architectures

With a solid understanding of Next.js and the various rendering strategies, I began designing and building my website. I decided to use GraphCMS, a headless content management system (CMS), to manage my website's content. This allowed me to create a modern, decoupled architecture that separated the frontend from the backend. Next.js can also easily integrate with other headless CMSs or data sources, making it a versatile choice for any project.

## Deployment

Once I had built my personal website, the final step was deployment. Next.js offers a variety of deployment options, from platforms like Vercel, DigitalOcean, and AWS to deploying on your own server. I opted to deploy my website using Vercel, as it provides a seamless integration with Next.js and offers excellent performance and scalability.

## Using Lee Robinson's Template

When I first started exploring Next.js, I came across an amazing portfolio website template created by Lee Robinson. The template, which can be found on his GitHub repository, is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PlanetScale, and Vercel. I was immediately drawn to its clean and modern design and decided to use it as a starting point for my own personal website.

### Setting Up the Template

The first step in using Lee's template was to clone the repository and set up the project on my local machine. I followed the instructions in the README.md file, which guided me through the process of installing the required dependencies and running the development server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io.git
cd leerob.io
pnpm install
pnpm run setup # Remove all of Lee's personal information
pnpm dev
```

After setting up the development environment, I created a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file provided in the repository. This allowed me to configure various settings, such as API keys and database connections.

## Customizing the Template

With the template up and running, it was time to make it my own. I began by removing all of Lee's personal information, images, and blog posts by running pnpm run setup. This ensured that I had a clean slate to work with when adding my own content.

Next, I started customizing the design and layout of the website to suit my preferences. I updated the colors, typography, and other visual elements using Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework. This made it easy to create a unique and personalized look for my website.

I also added new sections to showcase my work, experience, and skills. To do this, I leveraged the power of GraphCMS, which allowed me to manage and update my content easily through a user-friendly interface. By connecting my Next.js application to GraphCMS, I could seamlessly fetch and display my content on the website.

## Updating to Next.js 13

While working on my website, I noticed that Lee had recently refactored his template to use the new `app/` directory in Next.js 13. This feature enables better organization and easier scaling of Next.js applications. I decided to update my website to Next.js 13 as well, following Lee's example and making some adjustments to suit my project.

### Final Touches

With my website almost complete, I spent some time refining the user experience and making sure everything was polished and ready for launch. I implemented smooth scroll animations, responsive design, and improved accessibility features to ensure that my website would look and function well on a variety of devices and platforms.
